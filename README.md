# P2 - Music Sequencer

Music sequencer for creating melodies at different scales.

## Authors

## Getting Started

Note: You will have to have a local web server running to load fonts due to CORS browser security policy. I have configured the graphics to still run when font load fails, but I would recommend running a local web server to the folder containing index.html for full functionality. I will also provide a URL link below in case you do not have a local web server available. Please contact Russell Strauss (russellstrauss@gatech.edu, 678-549-2874) if you have any questions or need assistance running.


### Prerequisites

Node.js

### Installing

If you have Node.js installed on your machine, you can run the following commands in the root of this directory:

```
npm install
gulp
```

If it is your first time running gulp, you will need to run the following command only the first time:

```
npm install gulp -g
```

After running the gulp command, a new browser window will open with the project running.

### Controls

* On-screen UI

## Deployment

If you cannot run local web server, view project here: [http://jrstrauss.net/cg/tetrobot/](http://jrstrauss.net/cg/tetrobot/)
